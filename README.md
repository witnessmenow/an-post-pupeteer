# an-post-pupeteer

A Pupeteer script interacting with An Post's website to automate orders.

This is a serious work in progress, it's held together with sticky tape, but the basics of my use case are working.

It only supports Registered, large envelopes at the moment.

You will probably need to add additional countries to the arrays on the top of index.js
